@book{Calero.2015,
 abstract = {This is the first book that presents a comprehensive overview of sustainability aspects in software engineering. Its format follows the structure of the SWEBOK and covers the key areas involved in the incorporation of green aspects in software engineering, encompassing topics from requirement elicitation to quality assurance and maintenance, while also considering professional practices and economic aspects. The book consists of thirteen chapters, which are structured in five parts. First the {\textquotedbl}Introduction{\textquotedbl} gives an overview of the primary general concepts related to Green IT, discussing what Green in Software Engineering is and how it differs from Green by Software Engineering.~Next {\textquotedbl}Environments, Processes and Construction{\textquotedbl} presents green software development environments, green software engineering processes and green software construction in general. The third part, {\textquotedbl}Economic and Other Qualities,{\textquotedbl} details models for measuring how well software supports green software engineering techniques and for performing trade-off analyses between alternative green practices from an economic perspective. {\textquotedbl}Software Development Process{\textquotedbl} then details techniques for incorporating green aspects at various stages of software development, including requirements engineering, design, testing, and maintenance. In closing, {\textquotedbl}Practical Issues{\textquotedbl} addresses the repercussions of green software engineering on decision-making, stakeholder participation and innovation management. The audience for this book includes software engineering researchers in academia and industry seeking to understand the challenges and impact of green aspects in software engineering, as well as practitioners interested in learning about the state of the art in Green in Software Engineering.

@misc{Dodge.2022,
 abstract = {By providing unprecedented access to computational resources, cloud computing has enabled rapid growth in technologies such as machine learning, the computational demands of which incur a high energy cost and a commensurate carbon footprint. As a result, recent scholarship has called for better estimates of the greenhouse gas impact of AI: data scientists today do not have easy or reliable access to measurements of this information, precluding development of actionable tactics. Cloud providers presenting information about software carbon intensity to users is a fundamental stepping stone towards minimizing emissions. In this paper, we provide a framework for measuring software carbon intensity, and propose to measure operational carbon emissions by using location-based and time-specific marginal emissions data per energy unit. We provide measurements of operational software carbon intensity for a set of modern models for natural language processing and computer vision, and a wide range of model sizes, including pretraining of a 6.1 billion parameter language model. We then evaluate a suite of approaches for reducing emissions on the Microsoft Azure cloud compute platform: using cloud instances in different geographic regions, using cloud instances at different times of day, and dynamically pausing cloud instances when the marginal carbon intensity is above a certain threshold. We confirm previous results that the geographic region of the data center plays a significant role in the carbon intensity for a given cloud instance, and find that choosing an appropriate region can have the largest operational emissions reduction impact. We also show that the time of day has notable impact on operational software carbon intensity. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for how machine learning practitioners can use software carbon intensity information to reduce environmental impact.},

@misc{Lim.19.12.2019,
 abstract = {Multi-horizon forecasting problems often contain a complex mix of inputs -- including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed historically -- without any prior information on how they interact with the target. While several deep learning models have been proposed for multi-step prediction, they typically comprise black-box models which do not account for the full range of inputs present in common scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) -- a novel attention-based architecture which combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, the TFT utilizes recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for learning long-term dependencies. The TFT also uses specialized components for the judicious selection of relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of regimes. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and showcase three practical interpretability use-cases of TFT.},

The sixth edition provides expanded Discussion and Comments and References sections at the end of each chapter, creating a spotlight on practical applications of the theory presented in that chapter. New topics include rules for stochastic parallel machine scheduling and for stochastic online scheduling, models of flow shops with reentry, fixed parameter tractability, and new designs and implementations of scheduling systems. The main structure of the book as per previous edition consists of three parts. The first part focuses on deterministic scheduling and the related combinatorial problems. The second part covers probabilistic scheduling models; in this part it is assumed that processing times and other problem data are random and not known in advance. The third part deals with scheduling in practice; it covers heuristics that are popular with practitioners and discusses system design and implementation issues. All three parts of this new edition have been revamped and streamlined and the references have been made up-to-date. Theoreticians and practitioners alike will find this book of interest. Graduate students in operations management, operations research, industrial engineering, and computer science will find the book an accessible and invaluable resource. Scheduling - Theory, Algorithms, and Systems will serve as an essential reference for professionals working on scheduling problems in manufacturing, services, and other environments. Michael L. Pinedo is the Julius Schlesinger Professor of Operations Management in the Stern School of Business at New York University.

 abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},
